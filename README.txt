/**	Flash Cross-Domain Policy File Server:  Essentially a small file server that only servers-up one file,  a cross-domain policy file.
*	This is meant to serve policyy files to flash clients that wish to use socket communication with your server.  This code comes with an RDS service wrapper
*	so that you can easily hook it up to your RedDawrf Server.  Note, though, that the code runs fairly stand-alone to keep it from interfiering with server operation.

Make sure you set the properties for this class properly in your app.properties file.
Take a look at the accompanied 'app.properties' file for help with that.
